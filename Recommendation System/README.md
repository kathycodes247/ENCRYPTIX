# Recommendation System

This project creates a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. Techniques like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are used to recommend movies, books, or products to users.

**Installation**

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommendation-system.git
cd recommendation-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Usage**

_Collaborative Filtering_

Collaborative filtering recommends items based on the preferences of similar users. Here's an example using a user-item interaction matrix.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Sample user-item interaction matrix
user_item_matrix = np.array([
    [5, 3, 0, 1],
    [4, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 5],
    [1, 0, 0, 4],
    [0, 1, 5, 4],
])

# Calculate cosine similarity between users
user_similarity = cosine_similarity(user_item_matrix)

def recommend_items(user_index, user_item_matrix, user_similarity, num_recommendations=2):
    similar_users = user_similarity[user_index]
    item_scores = user_item_matrix.T.dot(similar_users) / np.array([np.abs(similar_users).sum(axis=0)])
    recommendations = np.argsort(item_scores)[::-1][:num_recommendations]
    return recommendations

# Example usage
user_index = 0
recommendations = recommend_items(user_index, user_item_matrix, user_similarity)
print(f"Recommended items for user {user_index}: {recommendations}")
```

_Content-Based Filtering_

Content-based filtering recommends items based on the features of the items and the user's past interactions.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel

# Sample item descriptions
item_descriptions = [
    "The movie is a thrilling adventure with stunning visuals.",
    "A romantic comedy that will make you laugh and cry.",
    "A documentary about the wonders of nature.",
    "An action-packed film with breathtaking stunts.",
    "A drama that explores complex human relationships.",
]

# Sample user preferences (liked item indices)
user_preferences = [0, 1]

# Vectorize item descriptions
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
tfidf_matrix = tfidf.fit_transform(item_descriptions)

# Calculate cosine similarity between items
item_similarity = linear_kernel(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)

def recommend_items_content(user_preferences, item_similarity, num_recommendations=2):
    similar_items = item_similarity[user_preferences].mean(axis=0)
    recommendations = np.argsort(similar_items)[::-1][:num_recommendations]
    return recommendations

# Example usage
recommendations = recommend_items_content(user_preferences, item_similarity)
print(f"Recommended items: {recommendations}")
```
