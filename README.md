This repository has 5 other sub-folders with different A.I. projects and respective README files for each to help out with project introduction and installation.

**CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES**
_A simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Used if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This provided a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow._

**IMAGE CAPTIONING**
_Combining computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. Used pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then used a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images._

**TIC-TAC-TOE AI**
_Implementing an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. Used algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable. This project will helped me understand game theory and basic search algorithms._

**RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM**
_Created a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. Used techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend movies, books, or products to users._

**FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION**
_Developing an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. Used pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace._
