# Face Detection and Recognition

This project develops an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. It uses pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors. Optionally, it adds face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace.
