# Tic-Tac-Toe A.I.

This project implements an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning, to make the AI player unbeatable. This project helps in understanding game theory and basic search algorithms.

**Installation**

To get started, clone the repository and install any required dependencies.
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
cd tic-tac-toe-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have any specific requirements
```

**Usage**

To play the game, run the following command:
```
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

**Minimax Algorithm**

The Minimax algorithm is a recursive method used to choose an optimal move for the AI by simulating all possible future moves.

**Alpha-Beta Pruning**

Alpha-Beta Pruning is an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.
